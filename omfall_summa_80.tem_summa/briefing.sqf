Soviet motorised infantry.
<br/>One of our patrols has seen roughly one platoon as well as one wheeled APC in the village.
<br/>Assumed to be capable to within 20 minutes initialise a counter-attack to retake the village.

player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["I. Situation","
A counter-attack forced our platoon to withdraw from the village SUMMA a few hours ago.
<br/>Now the enemy needs to be delayed from moving through SUMMA in order for our batallion to be able to safely regroup.
<br/>Additionally, the platoons vehicles were left behind in the village, which now is in the hands of the enemy.

player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["IMPORTANT NOTES!","
A setup timer is present in the mission.
<br/>
<br/>You should probably not cross into the combat zone while it is active.
<br/>
<br/>As this mission requires a fair amount of coordination among the squads all soldiers have been provided with radios, despite this being unrealistic for the time period.
<br/>Feel free to shout commands within your squad instead.

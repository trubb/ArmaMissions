Conduct an amphibious landing, and if possible seize the airfield in order to establish a beachhead for the task force.

player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["IIB. Friendly Forces","
You are one USMC infantry platoon with an attached LAV-25 IFV.
<br/>
<br/>You are the advance party, the rest of the battallion will be right behind you.
<br/>
<br/>You will be using RHIBs to reach the beach, making sure NOT to land in the minefields to the north and south of the objective.
<br/>
<br/>Frigates from Task Group 20 will shell the beach prior to your assault.
"]];

player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["IIA. Enemy Forces","
Cuban motorized and mechanized infantry.
<br/>
<br/>It is estimated that one motorized infantry company defends the beaches and the airfield.
<br/>
<br/>Additionally, signals intelligence point towards a mechanized unit being encamped at the radar station east of the airfield.
<br/>Expect reinforcements from there to come to the aid of the defenders of the airfield.
<br/>
<br/>Lastly you can expect at least one battery of ZU-23 AAA guns to be defending the airfield, all in accordance with Cuban doctrine.
<br/>
<br/>USMC Force Recon marines have surveyed the beach and scouted the adjacent strip of forest. 
Enemy fighting positions have been marked on the map thanks to their efforts.
s<br/>However you should keep in mind that the Cubans may very well improve their defenses at the sight of a US naval taskforce.

player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["I. Situation","
Cuban forces have been deployed to the Caribbean island group Pulau.
<br/>These islands are of high strategic importance as they lie adjacent to a major shipping route leading into the Panama Canal.
<br/>
<br/>For obvious reasons this is unacceptable, and the United States Congress has voted to allow an invasion of the isles.
"]];

player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["IMPORTANT NOTES","
A setup timer is present in the mission.
<br/>You should probably not leave the safety of your LPD or try to engage the enemy while it is active.
<br/>
<br/>A hard completion timer is also present.
<br/>After leaving the LPD dock you have 120 minutes to complete the mission.
<br/>
<br/>Keep in mind that the LAV-25 is VERY slow in the water compared to the RHIBs.
<br/>Also keep in mind that razorwire eats wheels.
<br/>
<br/>The platoon leader should add markers denoting staging points, phases, and objectives to the map during the briefing.

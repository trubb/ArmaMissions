Assault and clear out the one remaining Cuban stronghold on the island.

player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["IIB. Friendly Forces","
You are one USMC infantry platoon with an attached 81mm mortar team.
<br/>
<br/>You will be assaulting the Cuban stronghold while making sure NOT to stray in the minefields to the west and east of the objective.

Cuban infantry defending prepared fighting positions.
<br/>
<br/>It is estimated that up to a company worth of Cuban infantry is holed up in this stronghold.
<br/>
<br/>They are isolated in this position, all other Cuban forces on the islands have capitulated.
<br/>
<br/>To make matters worse the reason for these Cubans not surrendering is the fact that they are the remaining parts of a Cuban AAA batallion that has not lost their ZU-23 guns.
<br/>This in turn means that they are completely blocking the use of Gurun Airfield to the south, preventing US forces from flying in any humanitarian aid to the local populace.

player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["I. Situation","
Cuban forces have been deployed to the Caribbean island group Pulau.
<br/>These islands are of high strategic importance as they lie adjacent to a major shipping route leading into the Panama Canal.
<br/>
<br/>For obvious reasons this is unacceptable, and the United States Congress has voted to allow an invasion of the isles.
<br/>
<br/>At this point in the conflict all but a sole Cuban strongpoint has been LIBERATED.

player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["IMPORTANT NOTES","
A setup timer is present in the mission.
<br/>You should probably not leave the safety of the beach, or try to engage the enemy while it is active.
<br/>
<br/>A hard completion timer is also present.
<br/>After crossing into the jungle you have 70 minutes to complete the mission.
<br/>
<br/>Keep in mind that razorwire can be removed by use of a wirecutter.
<br/>
<br/>The platoon leader should add markers denoting staging points, phases, and objectives to the map during the briefing.

Attack the <marker name = 'opfor_junc'>5-way junction south of SUMMAJARVI</marker> to draw reinforcements away from the suspected coming attack in the east near <marker name = 'r61'>ROAD 61</marker>.
<br/>
<br/>Then withdraw northeast to the <marker name = 'blu_def'>defensive position</marker> west of ROAD 61 and reinforce the friendly forces already there.
<br/>
<br/>Lastly, delay the Russian assault for as long as possible.
<br/>
<br/>You may not withdraw unless explicitly ordered to do so.

player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["IIB. Friendly Forces","
You are one Swedish rifle platoon, roughly corresponding to the IB77 organisational model anno 1991.
<br/>
<br/>Friendly forces defend several <marker name = 'blu_def'>defensive</marker> <marker name = 'asa'>positions</marker> near <marker name = 'r61'>ROAD 61</marker>.

Russian motorised infantry.
<br/>The <marker name = 'opfor_junc'>5-way junction south of SUMMAJARVI</marker> is reportedly defended by a platoon-size force along with at least one BTR.
<br/>
<br/>Expect reinforcements to arrive quickly, as the russians are preparing an attack in the area.

player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["I. Situation","
Russian forces have seized the <marker name = 'opfor_junc'>5-way junction south of SUMMAJARVI</marker>, and are reportedly preparing an attack along <marker name = 'r61'>ROAD 61</marker>.
<br/>
<br/>In order to blunt the attack you have been tasked with attacking the 5-way junction, and then reinforce the defenses near ROAD 61.

player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["IMPORTANT NOTES","
A setup timer is present in the mission.
<br/>You should probably not cross into the combat zone while it is active.
<br/>
<br/>A hard completion timer is also present.
<br/>After crossing the red line you have 50 minutes to complete the mission.
<br/>
<br/>Due to inadequate stores your platoon has not been equipped with night vision devices.
<br/>Instead you have managed to scrounge together some 40mm flares for your squad leaders, and a flare gun for the platoon leader.
<br/>
<br/>For obvious reasons you should be conservative with the use of flares outside of combat lest the enemy finds out where you are.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>The platoon leader should add markers denoting a staging point(s) to the map during the briefing.

player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["IMPORTANT NOTES!","
A setup timer is present in the mission.
<br/>You should probably not cross into the combat zone while it is active.
<br/>
<br/>A hard completion timer is also present.
<br/>After crossing the red line you have 50 minutes to complete the mission.
<br/>
<br/>To make calculations easier the center point of the mortar squad is the mortar marker.
<br/>
<br/>Due to the era this mission is played in your force has no night vision devices or flashlights available.
<br/>Instead you will have to rely on flares fired by the mortar team if you require additional lightning.
<br/>
<br/>
<br>Additionally, due to an inadequate allocation of flare gun ammunition your flare guns should only to be used for signaling.
<br/>The platoon leader should establish a protocol for their use, for example to signal when a position has been taken.
